# azure-databricks-malware-prediction
End-to-end Machine Learning Pipeline demo using Delta Lake, MLflow and AzureML in Azure Databricks

# The Problem
The problem I set out to solve is this public [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction) hosted my Microsoft earlier this year. Essentially, Microsoft has provided datasets containing Windows telemetry data for a variety of machines; in order words - a dump of various windows features (Os Build, Patch version etc.) for machines like our laptops. The idea is to use the test.csv and train.csv dataset to develop a Machine Learning model that would predict a Windows machine's probability of getting infected with various families of malware.

# Connecting to Kaggle via API and copying competition files to Azure Blob Storage

The Kaggle API allows us to connect to various competitions and datasets hosted on the platform: [API documentation](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api).<BR>
  
**Pre-requisite**: You should have downloaded the _kaggle.json_ containing the API *username* and *key* and localized the notebook below.<br><br>
In this notebook, we will -<br>
  1. Mount a container called `bronze` in Azure Blob Storage
  2. Import the competition data set in .zip format from Kaggle to the mounted container
  3. Unzip the downloaded data set and remove the zip file
