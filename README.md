# Connecting to Kaggle via API and copying competition files to Azure Blob Storage

The Kaggle API allows us to connect to various competitions and datasets hosted on the platform: [API documentation](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api).<BR>
  
**Pre-requisite**: You should have downloaded the _kaggle.json_ containing the API *username* and *key* and localized the notebook below.<br><br>
In this notebook, we will -<br>
  1. Mount a container called `bronze` in Azure Blob Storage
  2. Import the competition data set in .zip format from Kaggle to the mounted container
  3. Unzip the downloaded data set and remove the zip file
